## Introduction
BugHunter is a web-based game where you swat bugs away from the screen. The bugs come in three different types/species (randomized order), adding some variety to the game.

## Features
- **Dynamic Movement**: Bugs move around the screen, no worries they don't go farther than the display
- **Diverse Bug Types**: Three different bug types: Bees, Beetles and Flies
- **Ambient Sound**: Scheming weasel
- **Celebration Prompt**: Currently end of the game, planned to be improved upon
- **Credits**: Shows credits, try reading them when the bugs are crawling over them!
