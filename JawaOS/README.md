## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Pull requests are gladly accepted.

1. Clone the project.
2. Multiple .html files are available (index.html is the main program, everything else is an individual program).
3. You may add additional programs by adding an extra button and an entity with matching data. For example, look at the credits pattern (right before the scripts begin near line 126 in index.html) and replicate it for your own program. It's as simple as adding an iframe.
4. Open a pull request.
